***Version 1 Completed 7 April 2020***

This is the first version of a Income Tax Calculator created with the sole purpose of Calculating income taxes of an individuals in 
context of the South African Income Tax Act.(I used Python 3.8.0)

I am a novice so just created it for learning purposes. I am an accountant by trade so chose tax tables as I thought the
income tax tables would provide good context in terms of some very basic structuring and referencing of data.(I also understand the business
logic behind taxes, so did not still need to relearn the entire process behind calculating taxes, could focus on code and program structure.)

Base purpose of Program is that it should ask for 3 inputs from user:

1. Gross Income
2. Age(Determines rebates the user is eligible for)
3. Select from the applicabe financial year(selected historically 2019 & 2020 and 1 Active year(2021).

After which income tax to be calculated based on numerous calculations.

The aspects of Python I focussed on was:

1. Getting a better understanding of Functions.(The entire script is a combination of functions and functions calling other functions)
2. Some basic work with loops and conditions
3. Preparing basic data structures using list/dictionaries and combining them nested dictionaries inside of list.
4. Looping through lists and creating an index based on that list which is used in another list to determine the applicable nested dictionary.
5. Referencing to other python files. Tried to seperate the python file where data(Tax Information is stored) and where calculations are done.

Still a lot to learn and will expand a lot more in Version 2/3/4/etc. as my understanding grow.

***Any feedback welcome in terms of streamlining the script***


Disclaimer: This is not a finalised version of calculating Income Tax and there is a lot more complexity to the matter,if by chance you need help with income tax in South Africa, please contact a a relevant specialist to assist and DO NOT use this software for that purpose!!!!
